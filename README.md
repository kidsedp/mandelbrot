Interactive visualization of the Mandelbrot Set

## What is the Mandelbrot Set?
The Mandelbrot is a famous fractal that shows up in the complex numbers by iterating the function z+1&nbsp;=&nbsp;z<sup>2</sup>+c from z = 0, where c is any point on the complex plane. Even though the math sounds complicated, you don't need to understand it to be able to appreciate the intricate beauty of the Mandelbrot Set.
